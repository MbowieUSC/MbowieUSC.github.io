            Hello! My name is Mikhelyn Bowie and I am a student at the University of South Carolina pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Implementing my creative passions with the endless possibilites of technology is very important to me. I work best with in groups or with a partner due to my ability to regard every possible solution and oppourtunity in a project. My goal is to use my creative skills along with technology in order to create better financial situations for everyone wanting to further their education into the collegiate level.
